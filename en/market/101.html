           <p>Abstract:          </p>
           <p>
            The dollar fell sharply on Thursday as dovishness about the fed's interest-rate decision drove the dollar index to a five-session low, breaking 97 points. Non-us currencies and commodities such as gold and crude oil benefited and rose sharply. Spot gold hit $1,394.11 an ounce, its highest since August 30, 2013. The fed's decision to keep interest rates unchanged at 2.25%-2.5%, a statement that lowered its assessment of the economy's balance, and a shift in the grid, suggest a rate cut at some point in the future is appropriate. Fed funds futures point to an increased chance that the federal reserve will cut interest rates in July. Expectations of a rate cut sent the dollar tumbling and non-u.s. gold prices up.
In more concrete news, the bank of Japan on Thursday left monetary policy unchanged after the federal reserve signaled it was willing to cut interest rates amid growing threats to growth. 'the central bank left interest rates and asset purchases unchanged and all 50 economists surveyed expected no change,' the statement said. Rba chairman Stephen lowy said the possibility of a rate cut was still being discussed and it was "unrealistic" to expect a further cut in cash rates and to think a quarter-point cut would alter the path of economic growth. The speech on the Australian dollar to form a certain support, the Australian dollar took advantage of the rebound. The battle for the British prime minister: Johnson leads three times in a row, boosting his chances; The pound continued to rebound as the domestic situation stabilised. As the dust settles on the fed's June rate decision, the focus turns to the bank of England's decision and minutes at 19:00 Beijing time.</p>
