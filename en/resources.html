                    <p>More and more investors are in favor of the foreign exchange market. First of all, his advantages are small investment, small risk and multiple returns. Especially for foreign exchange investors, the most attractive factor is foreign exchange margin trading. To become the new darling of international investors is closely related to the characteristics of the foreign exchange market itself. The main features of the foreign exchange market are:</p>

                              <h5>there is no market</h5>
                              <p>There are basically two sets of financial systems in the western industrial countries, namely, centralized trading and central operation and no unified fixed place business network. Stock trading is bought and sold through exchanges.For example, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Tokyo Stock Exchange are the main trading places for stocks in the United States, Britain and Japan. Financial commodities are traded centrally. They have unified provisions on quotation, trading time and settlement procedures. They have established trade associations and formulated trade codes.

                                Investors are buying and selling the goods needed by the brokerage firm, which means "there are markets." Foreign exchange trading is carried out through a network of traders who do not operate the market in a unified way. It does not have a centralized and unified location like stock trading. However, the foreign exchange trading network is global, and has formed an organization without organization. The market is linked by a recognized way and advanced information systems. Traders do not have membership in any organization, but must be trusted and recognized by the same industry.
                                
                                Such a foreign exchange market without a unified venue is known as "market without market". The global foreign exchange market is trading on average trillions of dollars per day. Such huge sums of money are cleared and transferred w。</p>
                              <h5>Cycle operation</h5>
                              <p>Due to the different geographical position of the financial centres in the world, the Asian, European and American markets have become a 24-hour continuous global foreign exchange market because of the time lag. The New York market opens at 8:30 a.m. (New York time), Chicago at 9:30 a.m., San Francisco at 10:30 a.m., Sydney at 18:30 a.m., Tokyo at 19:30 a.m., Hong Kong and Singapore at 20:30 a.m., Frankfurt at 2:30 a.m., London at 3:30 a.m.

                                Such 24-hour uninterrupted operation, the foreign exchange market has become a day and night market, only on Saturdays, Sundays and major national festivals, the foreign exchange market will be closed. This continuous operation provides investors with an ideal place to invest without time and space barriers, investors can find the best time to trade.
                                
                                For example, if an investor buys yen in New York in the morning, the yen rises in the evening after the opening of the Hong Kong market, and the investor sells in the Hong Kong market, he can participate in any market, any time, no mat</p>
                              <h5>Zero sum game</h5>
                              <p>In the stock market, if a certain stock or the whole stock market rises or falls, then the value of a certain stock or the stock value of the whole stock market will rise or fall. For example, the stock price of Nippon Railway dropped from 800 yen to 400 yen, and the value of Nippon Railway's entire stock will also be reduced by half.

                                However, in the foreign exchange market, the fluctuation of the exchange rate represents a totally different change in the amount of value and the amount of stock value, because the exchange rate refers to the exchange rate of the two currencies, and the change in the exchange rate is the decrease in the value of one currency and the increase in the t</p>

                                The smallest unit of exchange rate changes in foreign exchange transactions. One point refers to the last number of quotations for each commodity. Take Euro/US dollar as an example, assuming the current latest market quotation is 1.3839, one point refers to 0.0001.
                                
                                
                                Order Type
                                An order is an order given by a trader to execute a transaction. Customer terminals consist of the following types of orders: market value transactions, pending transactions, stops/gains, and tracking stops.
                                
                                
                                Exchange rate / quotation
                                Exchange rate is the exchange rate between the two currencies, that is, the exchange rate of one currency unit to another.
                                
                                
                                Basic currency
                                The base currency is the left currency in the monetary composition, which represents the value of the relative currency in the monetary composition. For example, the euro / dollar exchange rate is 1.3525, that is, the euro is the base currency, and the value is 1.3525 dollars.
                                
                                
                                Relative currency
                                Relative currencies, also known as quoted currencies or base currencies, refer to the right-hand currencies in the monetary portfolio, and the exchange rate of a pair of currencies represents a unit of base money relative to the number of units of relative currencies. For example, in the Euro/US dollar portfolio, the relative currency is the US dollar; assuming the Euro/US exchange rate is 1.3616, it means that one Euro is convertible to US $1.3616.

                                Before hedging the number of "buy-up" contracts, the buy contract is a long position, also known as "long"; the sell contract is a short position, also known as "short".
                                
                                
                                Leverage ratio
                                Leverage ratio refers to the ratio between the margin required for opening a position and the value of the commodity contract. That is, the contract value, the initial margin = the leverage ratio of the commodity.

                                All currency transactions are based on 100000 yuan base currency, which is the 1 standard.For example, the euro / dollar trading contract for 1 hands is 100000 euros.
                                
                                
                                Margin trading
                                Margin trading means that in the course of trading, investors do not need to make full payment of the real value of the trading commodities, but only need to pay a certain proportion of the total amount of the transaction as a performance guarantee.
                                
                                
                                Building a warehouse
                                Warehousing is the establishment of orders, if you predict a product price will rise, you need to "buy" warehousing; if you predict a product price will fall, you need to "sell" warehousing. The "market price" is based on the latest market price. "Hanging list" can set the transaction price by itself, when the market price reaches the set price, the system will automatically close the transaction and build a warehouse.
                                
                                
                                Net worth
                                Net value means that the profit or loss of an open order is included in the actual balance shown in the calculation and will vary with the position.

                                Interest
                                The interest rate will be generated if the order of the customer has not been liquidated for second days. Overnight orders must be paid / charged overnight. Since each transaction involves two currencies, including two different interest rates, the payment or collection of interest is determined by the interest margin between the two currencies and the position orientation. Interest is calculated on the basis of international bank practice T+2 delayed liquidation, that is, two banking days after the start of the calculation. (Note: Interest is not calculated on the International Holiday Day, and the overnight interest for an additional day is calculated two working days in advance.)
                                
                                
                                Close a position
                                Close a previously bought (sold) transaction by selling (buying) an equal number of contract transactions. That is to say, the order for buying and building a warehouse is closed at the selling price, while the order for selling and building a warehouse is closed at the buying price.

                                When the margin ratio is less than 30%, the system will force the account holder's warrant to liquidate the order with the largest loss until the margin ratio is restored to more than 30%.

                                The "market quotation" window of the trading platform includes the two labels of "commodity list" and "instant picture". The item list label shows the latest quotations for each item and item, and when you click on the item list and switch to the Immediate Chart, you can see the immediate trend of the item.

                                Trading in the latest quotation of goods must be carried out within the scope of the transaction. If the price volatility of the commodity price is too high to exceed the transaction scope, the trading order will not be implemented.

                                Hanging order transaction refers to the customer can set an expected transaction price, when the market price reaches the price set by the customer, the system will automatically execute the transaction order. The maximum validity period of the order is a trading week. The list is divided into 4 categories: Buy Limit: A buy order with a target price lower than the current market price. Buy Stop: A buy order with a target price higher than the current market price. Sell Limit: Sell Limit refers to an order to sell at a target price higher than the current market price. Sell Stop: Sell Stop refers to an order to sell at a target price below the current market price.

                                Stop loss is a protective mechanism, which means that when a loss of an investment reaches a set stop loss price, the system automatically executes orders to cut positions out of the market in time to avoid greater losses. The goal is to limit the loss to a smaller range even when the investment is wrong.

                                <p>GDP refers to the value of all the final products and services produced in the economy of a country or region within a certain period of time (a quarter or a year), and is often recognized as the best indicator of the state of the economy. It can not only reflect the economic performance of a country, but also reflect the national strength and wealth of a country.</p>
                                <p>Importance

                                  Very high, especially when compared with market expectations, the actual release of economic growth or recession rates often dictates the direction of financial markets. The higher the data, the stronger the economic growth</p>
                                <p>Why (why do investors care?)

                                  A country's GDP has increased substantially, reflecting the country's booming economic development, increased national income and increased consumption capacity. In this case, the central bank will be likely to raise interest rates, tighten the money supply, the country's good economic performance and the rise in interest rates will increase the attractiveness of the currency. Conversely, if a country's GDP grows negatively, it shows that the country's economy is in a recession and consumption capacity is reduced. At this point, the central bank may cut interest rates to stimulate the economy to grow again, and the attraction of the country's currency will diminish as interest rates fall and economic performance weakens. Therefore, generally speaking, high economic growth rate will drive up the exchange rate of the domestic currency, while low economic growth rate will cause the exchange rate of the national currency to fall

                                  GDP represents all economic activities within a country, reflects the basic situation of economic growth, and is used to analyze the current state of economic development. GDP growth rate accelerated, indicating that the economy is in the expansion stage, the consumption demand for production materials will increase. Usually the higher the GDP in the US means the better the economic development, the higher interest rate and the stronger dollar exchange rate

                                  Consumer price index (CPI)
Consumer price index (CPI), also known as consumer price index (CPI), is a measure of the price of a fixed basket of consumer goods. It mainly reflects the price changes of goods and services paid by consumers. It is also a tool to measure the level of inflation in the form of percentage changes. It is also a price change indicator used to measure the prices of products and services related to the lives of residents.The major commodities that make up the index in the United States fall into seven categories, including food, alcohol and beverages, housing, clothing, transportation, medical health, entertainment, and other goods and services. In the United States, the CPI is published monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. There are two different CPIs. The first is the CPI of workers and staff, or CPW. The two is the consumer price index of urban consumers, or CPIU.

Importance

High usually affects financial markets, and its timeliness and inflationary implications are widely tracked

Why (why do investors care?)

Consumer price indices are important and revelatory and must be handled with caution, as they are sometimes announced to rise and currencies to exchange rates to the contrary. Because the level of CPI indicates the purchasing power of consumers, but also reflects the economic situation, if the index falls, reflecting the economic recession, is bound to be unfavorable to the currency exchange rate trend. But if the consumer price index rises, is the exchange rate necessarily favorable? Not necessarily, it depends on the "rise" of the consumer price index. If the index rises moderately, it indicates that the economy is stable and upward, which is beneficial to the currency of the country, but if the index rises too much, it will have a negative impact because the price index is inversely proportional to the purchasing power. The more expensive the price index is, the lower the purchasing power of the currency is, which is bound to be detrimental to the currency of the country. If the interest rate is considered, the impact of the index on foreign exchange rate will be more complicated.

frequency

When a country's CPI rises, it indicates that its inflation rate rises, that is, the purchasing power of its currency weakens. According to the theory of purchasing power parity, its currency should weaken. On the contrary, when a country's CPI declines, it indicates that the country's inflation rate drops, that is, the purchasing power of the currency rises. According to PPP theory, the country's currency should strengthen. However, since all countries have to control inflation as the primary task, rising inflation also brings the opportunity for interest rates to rise, so on the contrary, favor the currency. If inflation is controlled and falls and interest rates tend to fall at the same time, it will weaken the currency of the region. The policy of lowering the inflation rate will lead to the "tequila effect", a common phenomenon in Latin American countries.

Producer Price Index
Producer Price Index (PPI), abbreviated as PPI, is mainly used to measure the price changes of various commodities in different stages of production. Like consumer price index (CPI), PPI is often used as an important index to observe the level of inflation,It is used to measure the delivery price changes of products in factories, farms and processing plants. Considering that the two components of food and energy often fluctuate sharply due to seasonal factors, the report calculates the core price after deducting the two components, which is called the producer price core index.

Importance

High usually affects financial market trends, and its timeliness and inflationary implications are widely tracked

Why (why do investors care?)

For the foreign exchange market, the market is more concerned about the monthly change of the final product PPI. As food prices increase due to seasonal variations, and energy prices often fluctuate unexpectedly, in order to better reflect the overall price changes of commodities, the changes in food and energy prices are generally eliminated, thus forming a "core producer price index" to further observe the trend of inflation.

Interpretation

Generally speaking, when the PPI increases substantially and continues to accelerate, the central bank responds by raising interest rates to prevent inflation from rising rapidly, which increases the likelihood that the currency will appreciate, and vice versa.

U.S. capital inflows
Capital flow refers to the transfer of capital from one country or region to another country or region. Net capital inflows mainly refer to the net inflows of foreign investors for purchasing national debt, stocks and other securities. International capital flow can refer not only to the international transfer of capital in monetary form, but also to the international transfer of factors of production (or physical capital such as equipment, technology, labor force, etc.), which is generally measured by converting physical capital into monetary value

Importance

normal

Why (why do investors care?)

When faced with a large influx of capital, a central bank can adopt two different attitudes: one is not to anticipate the foreign exchange market, allowing the appreciation of the domestic currency caused by the influx of foreign capital, and the other is to intervene in the exchange rate of the foreign exchange market to buy and sell the local currency while in the bond market. Selling Treasury bonds to offset the increase in base currency to stabilize the local currency. The second point is corresponding to the first point. As in Thailand and Malaysia, these countries have relatively maintained exchange rate stability by stepping up government intervention, although this stability is actually fragile in the face of deteriorating domestic economic conditions.

Interpretation

The inflow of international capital has led to a substantial increase in the supply of money in various countries. In fact, there is not necessarily an inevitable link between the inflow of international capital and a country's money supply, which largely depends on governments'exchange rate policies and so-called offsetting strategies

Importance

Very high

Why (why do investors care?)

Retail sales data have an important guiding role in determining a country's economic status and prospects, because retail sales directly reflect changes in consumer spending. In western developed countries, consumer spending usually accounts for more than half of the national economy, such as the United States, Britain and other countries, this proportion can account for two-thirds. An increase in retail sales represents an increase in consumer spending, an improvement in the economy, an increase in interest rates that may be favorable for the currency, or a decrease in retail sales that may represent a slowing or poor economy, a decrease in interest rates that may be negative for the currency.

Interpretation

In the United States, the Department of Commerce Statistics conducts a monthly nationwide retail sampling survey of retailers of various types and sizes (all registered companies in the Department of Commerce). Because the retail industry covers a wide range, random sampling is adopted to obtain more representative data. Retailers of durable goods include auto retailers, supermarkets, drug and alcohol dealers. Because the data of service industry is difficult to collect and calculate, it is excluded. However, service industry is also an important part of consumption expenditure. The increase and decrease of consumption can be obtained from the data of personal consumption expenditure (including goods retail and services).

Unemployment Rate
The unemployment rate is another item in the employment report. It refers to the number of workers who are willing to work but have not yet worked for a certain period of time.

importance

very high

Why (why do investors care?)

Through the unemployment rate data, we can judge the employment situation of all the working population in a certain period. The unemployment rate has long been seen as an indicator of the overall economic situation, and it is the first monthly economic data to be published, so foreign exchange traders and researchers like to use the unemployment rate index to predict other relevant indicators, such as industrial production, personal income and even new housing construction.

Interpretation

Generally speaking, the decline of unemployment rate represents the healthy development of the whole economy and is conducive to the appreciation of the currency; the rise of unemployment rate represents the slowdown of economic development and is not conducive to the appreciation of the currency. If we analyze the unemployment rate with the inflation index of the same period, we can know whether the economy was overheated, whether it would cause pressure to raise interest rates, or whether we need to reduce interest rates to stimulate economic development. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has a monthly nationwide sample survey of households. If the unemployment rate in the U.S. falls this month from the previous month, it indicates an increase in employment, a better overall economic situation and a favorable rise in the dollar. If the unemployment rate is large, indicating a possible recession in the US economy, it will have an adverse effect on the US dollar.

Initial Jobless Claims
The number of first-time jobless claims reflects the number of people queuing up in front of state unemployment assistance agencies to claim unemployment insurance benefits, and the number of first-time or continuing claims is equally important. The report does not calculate the percentage of people working (or not working) according to the total amount of labor measured. It measures the number of people waiting in line to receive unemployment insurance benefits.

importance

High will affect the market trend

Why (why do investors care?)

This index is also one of the most attractive economic indicators in the market. Because employment is a driving force for future economic development, this is a forward-looking indicator. At present, the United States is a completely consumer society, consumer intentions are the greatest driving force of the economy, if many Americans lose their jobs every week and apply for unemployment benefits, it will seriously inhibit consumer confidence. And because the data are released every week, which is the focus of the investment market, the huge increase in unemployment, the U.S. government's financial pressure will increase, for the U.S. economy suffered from "bipolar disease" is also a test, so the government will take appropriate policies to stimulate the economy's momentum.

Interpretation

The number of jobless claims is one of the indicators reflecting the domestic labor market situation. The increase in initial claims for unemployment benefits reflects an increase in the number of laid-offs or in the difficulty of finding new jobs. The index is the second indicator reflecting the state of the labor market, and the monthly employment report issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics has attracted more attention. The payment of unemployment benefits is not for all unemployed people, but for "conditional payment".

Changes in non-farm payrolls
Number of Non-agricultural Employees: A project in the Employment Report that focuses on changes in jobs other than those engaged in agricultural production, published along with the unemployment rate

Importance

Very high

Why (why do investors care?)

The number of non-farm employment reflects the development and growth of the manufacturing and service industries. The decrease in the number of non-farm employment represents a reduction in production by enterprises and a depression in the economy. When social economy is fast, consumption naturally increases, and jobs in consumer and service industries also increase.

Interpretation

When the number of non-agricultural jobs rises sharply, it indicates a healthy economic situation, which should theoretically be beneficial to the exchange rate and may herald higher interest rates, while potentially high interest rates encourage the foreign exchange market to push the value of the country's currency more, and vice versa. Therefore, the data is an important indicator to observe the degree and state of social economic and financial development. The release of the data is likely to be a turning point in determining the direction of the foreign exchange market, and may also bring about intense volatility in the foreign exchange market.

When the employment situation is weak (strong), the bond market will pick up and fall. The property investment market is picking up with the weak data bond market, because low interest rates are good for stocks. But sometimes the two markets are developing in opposite directions. After all, the labour market is good for the stock market, because it promotes economic growth and corporate profits. At the same time, bond traders are more concerned about the potential of inflation pressure

Interpretation

Unemployment rose during cyclical recession and fell during the period of rapid economic growth. The rise in unemployment is related to economic weakness or contracting and falling interest rates. On the contrary, the decline of unemployment rate is related to economic development and interest rate rise. In this way, people are afraid that if the unemployment rate is too low and the workers are hard to find, wages will increase.

Generally speaking, if the average hourly wage is expected to cause interest rates to rise, then the rapid rise in hourly wages will create a positive stimulus for the currency, and vice versa. In the United States, the index is monitored by the Federal Reserve.

Interpretation

The hourly income data reflect the changes in the base hourly wage rate and the bonus growth for overtime work. Average hourly wages may reflect the trend of changes in wages and wage costs earlier in the industry and complement the employment cost index, providing a reference for measuring the total labor cost

The increase in housing starts will increase employment in the construction industry. Newly purchased households usually buy other durables. Through the multiplier effect, the output and employment of other industries will increase. Changes in housing construction will directly point to economic recession or recovery.

Interpretation

When the economy turns into recession, it is the first indicator to start falling; when the economy recovers, it is the first indicator to rise. Because the sale of new houses is the number of houses that have signed sales contracts, buyers usually subscribe to their homes through mortgages and mortgages, so they are more sensitive to the current mortgage rate
